 Mental Health Fitness Tracker
The AI Mental Health Fitness Tracker is a Google Colab-based program that utilizes Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to track, analyze, and provide insights into mental health and substance use disorders. This tool leverages the datasets "mental-and-substance-use-as-share-of-disease" and "prevalence-by-mental-and-substance-use-disorder" to offer a comprehensive understanding of mental health trends and patterns.

## Features
Data Analysis: The program performs in-depth analysis on the provided datasets, uncovering trends and correlations related to mental health and substance use disorders.
AI Insights: Leveraging AI algorithms, the tool provides personalized insights and recommendations based on the analysis of the datasets.
Data Visualization: The program offers visualizations and graphs to facilitate a better understanding of mental health and substance use disorder prevalence.

## Getting Started
To use the Mental Health Fitness Tracker in Google Colab, follow these steps:

Ensure that you have a Google Colab account.
Clone or download the repository containing the AI Mental Health Fitness Tracker code and datasets.
Launch Google Colab and open a new Python notebook.
Upload the Jupyter Notebook file and the datasets to your Google Colab environment.
Run each code cell in sequence to load and analyze the datasets, generate AI insights, and visualize the data.

## Usage
Once you open the Jupyter Notebook file in Google Colab, you will see the code cells and instructions.
Run each code cell in sequence to load and analyze the datasets, generate AI insights, and visualize the data.
Follow the prompts and read the output to gain insights into mental health and substance use disorders.

## Datasets
The Mental Health Fitness Tracker utilizes two datasets:

"mental-and-substance-use-as-share-of-disease.csv": This dataset provides information about the share of mental and substance use disorders in the overall burden of disease.
"prevalence-by-mental-and-substance-use-disorder.csv": This dataset contains prevalence rates for various mental and substance use disorders.
Please ensure that you upload the datasets to your Google Colab environment before running the code.
